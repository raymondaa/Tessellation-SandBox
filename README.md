# Tessellation-SandBox

#### A 2D tessellation sandbox to see how two shape will be tessellated with in a 2D evironment. This is essentially taking the union of the two shapes.

#### ***OpenGL*** is used as a rendering environment along with the libraries ***BOOST, GLFW, GLM, and GLEW*** for their utility functions.

##### ***BOOST, GLFW, GLM and GLEW*** are not included due to the large files sizes


## *Examples*

#### Pressing *Z* will render the two base triangles

#### Pressing *X* will highlight the intersecting lines in red

![EX. 2](/examples/triangles_found_intersections.PNG)

#### Pressing *C* will render the new tessellated shape

#### Pressing *A* will render the two new random triangles to play with

## Future Work

#### - Get more shapes to work with intersection logic and tessellation
#### - possibly move to 3D
